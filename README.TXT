Part 2 of lab: better-ticket-machine project 
Question 47: No thew balance never changes after the error messege. 
Question 48: After running some test and my predictions were rigth, it wouldnt make any difference in the method. 
Question 49: when i inserted the money it goes to the "int getbalance" and when i inserted 0 in the "int getbalance" it stays at 0. when i insert -50 it still stays 0. 
Question 50: 
Question 51: In the naive-ticket-machine we see that the printTicket is way different the the better-ticket-machine ex: in the naive it was structured like this;  ##################
# The BlueJ Line
# Ticket
# price cents.
##################  while in the better-ticket one its built like this: Use a positive amount rather than: 50
Use a positive amount rather than: 100
Use a positive amount rather than: 150
Use a positive amount rather than: -50
The println is different in both machines. 
Question 52: yes it is possible. But it shows this message in the printTicket; ##################
# The BlueJ Line
# Ticket
# 0 cents.
##################

You must insert at least 0 more cents. 
Question 53: No it cant because when you insertMoney it wont let you go more lower then 0. 
Question 54: *(multiplication), /(division)
Question 55: saving = price * discount;
Question 56: mean = total / count; 
Question 59: 
Question 60: It shows an Error saying "unreacheble statement". 60.1; because the methods ends after putting a return statement. 
Question 61: When i put the value at 10, but when i inspect the value it shows 0 instead of 10.
